                In the overview of the book, we are introduced to the two central characters, 
                Charlie and Michael. Charlie, the older and wiser of the two, mentors Michael, 
                a young maintenance worker seeking guidance on achieving success. Charlie admires 
                Michael's drive for self-improvement and imparts wisdom by introducing him to 
                "The Twelve Pillars," a book authored by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener.

            <h2>CHAPTER 4 REVEIW</h2>
            <p>
                In this chapter, Michael and Charlie meet at Mack's Diner to talk about Michael's 
                relationship with Amy and his career goals. Michael tells Charlie that he has
                been using the garden metaphor to improve his relationship with Amy, and that it
                has been working well. He has started making more time for her by going out on a date 
                night every week. Charlie encourages Michael to keep up the good work, but reminds him 
                that a relationship needs constant care and attention, just like a garden.
            </p>

            <p>
                Michael also tells Charlie that he is feeling unfulfilled in his career. 
                He wishes he was further along and feels like he is not living up to his potential. 
                Charlie asks Michael about his career goals, and they have a discussion about what Michael 
                wants to achieve.

            <h2>CHAPTER 5 REVEIW</h2>
            <p>
                In this chapter, Charlie and Michael discuss the importance of having goals and
                living a life that is aligned with those goals. Charlie tells Michael about the
                "pain of discipline" vs. the "pain of regret" and encourages Michael to choose discipline 
                over regret.
            </p>

            <p>
                Charlie also talks about the importance of time management and being the master of 
                your time, rather than letting your time control you. He tells Michael that if he 
                doesn't design his own life plan, he is likely to fall into someone else's plan, which
                 may not be in his best interests.
            </p>

            <p>
                Michael appreciates Charlie's advice, but he feels like he doesn't have the time 
                to focus on his goals right now. He is too busy with work and family obligations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Charlie reminds Michael that life is expensive and that each day is a gift. 
                He encourages Michael to spend his time wisely and to focus on the things that 
                are most important to him.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, this chapter is about the importance of living a purposeful life and 
                making the most of your time. Charlie's advice is timely and relevant, 
                and it is something that everyone can benefit from.

            <h2>CHAPTER 6 REVEIW</h2>

            <p>
                In this chapter, Charlie and Michael discuss the importance of surrounding yourself with the
                best people. Charlie tells Michael that he needs to ask himself the following questions about his friends:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Who am I arround?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What effect are they having on me?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What have they got me reading?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What have they got me saying?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where do they have me going?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Charlie also introduces Michael to Mr. Davis's principle of the three 
                categories of association: Disassociation, limited association, and 
                expanded association. Michael realizes that his friends are not helping 
                him to grow in the direction he wants, and he needs to decide whether 
                to limit or even disassociate with them.

            <h2>CHAPTER 7 REVEIW</h2>

            <p>
                In this chapter, Charlie and Michael discuss the importance of lifelong learning. 
                Charlie argues that formal education is not enough to achieve success, 
                and that self-education is the key. He encourages Michael to read books, 
                learn from successful people, and reflect on his own experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                Michael is initially resistant to the idea of reading books, 
                but Charlie convinces him to give it a try by giving him a free copy of 
                "The Magic of Thinking Big." Michael agrees to read the book and continue learning from Charlie.
            </p>

            <p>
                The chapter ends with Michael feeling grateful for the time he gets to 
                spend with Charlie and excited to start his new journey of lifelong learning.
            </p>

            <p>In conclusion, these chapters offer valuable life lessons that resonate deeply with my experience as 
                a university student. They underscore the importance of setting and pursuing personal goals, efficient 
                time management, and the profound influence of one's social circle. Personally, I aspire to a career 
                in game development and programming. These chapters emphasize that my goals should be defined, time 
                well-managed, and that I should surround myself with motivated individuals who inspire growth. Moreover, 
                they encourage me to prioritize self-education, a principle I have embraced as I strive to acquire knowledge 
                and skills beyond the classroom. In particular, Chapter 6 has left a lasting impression, motivating me to seek 
                out inspiring individuals who can push me to achieve greater heights.</p>
