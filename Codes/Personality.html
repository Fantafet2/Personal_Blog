        <div class="strongestTraits">
            <h2>STRONGEST EMOTIONS</h2>

            <p>
                My strongest trait is the abilty to stay calm and compsoed through most situations. This trait of mine is
                something which most people are incapeble of. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="strongestEmotion">
            <h2>STRONGEST EMOTIONS</h2>
            <p>The word/phrase that can best describe my strongest mood is being in an Euthymic mood
                it can be described as a state of "okayness". where an individual is neither happy nor sad
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="hobby">
            <h2>HOBBY</h2>
            <p>like most my people my age my hobbies do include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gaming</li>
                <li>Watching TV</li>
                <li>Surfing the internet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>but my unique hobbies which most people wouldn't think of doing is learning how to use different programing languages</p>
            <p>for example this summer i made a card gaame wich my sister and I made up using HTML, CSS and Javascript,
                it is not a finished product as yet so i won't be publishing it as yet
            </p>
            
            <h4>Below i wsa video demo of how far that game has reached</h4>
            <p>this game was made up completely by my sister and I, from the concept
                to the layout to the implimentation 
            </p>
            <video class="hobbyvid" src="Assets/hobby_video_demo.mp4" controls></video>

            <p>As you can see the game is operational but not in a good way</p>
        </div>

            <h2>MY ICON</h2>
            <h3>The late Juice Wrld(Jarad Anthony Higgins)</h3>

            <h3>A MESSAGE FROM JUICE WRLD</h3>

            <P>Jarad Anthony Higgins more commonly known as Juice Wrld (Pronounced world)
                is the person i look up to the most, he was just a teenager when he started 
                his career. He died st the age of 21 on December 8th 2019, six days after his birthday
            </P>
            <p>
                The reason I look up to Juice Wrld is because even thought he was so young
                he inspired millions accross the world and convinced countless people that there life 
                was not meaningless through his music
